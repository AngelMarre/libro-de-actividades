<h1>Java ChatRoom Applet Demo</h1>
<p>This is a <em>very</em> simple Chat Room applet.
Note that if you try to load it from your <em>local</em> machine
as opposed to a server, you won't have much luck, since Java Applets
are only allowed - for very good security reasons - to open a network
connection back to where they came from!  Load it from the server instead.
</p><hr>
<applet code="ChatRoom" width="500" height="100" alt="">
	<param name="port" value="9999">
	This will only work with a Java-enabled browser.
</applet>
<p>The Chat Room should appear in its own window. If it does not,
check to make sure that you have a Java-enabled Web Browser.
Check to make sure that the Chat Window is not hidden behind another
window, too (on systems with an IconPanel or a TaskBar, look there!).
</p><hr>
<p>Use <a href="ChatRoom.java">The Source</a>, Luke.
Alternately, see <a href="ChatServer.java">the server source</a>.
