<h1>Java ChatRoom Applet Demo</h1>
<p>This is a <em>very</em> simple Chat Room applet.
</p><p><a href="http://server/chat/chat.html">Load the Applet from the server</a>.
</p><p>Note that if you try to load it from your <em>local</em> machine
as opposed to a server, you won't have much luck, since Java Applets
are only allowed - for very good security reasons - to open a network
connection back to where they came from!
So, the applet will start, but you will NOT be able to login.
Load it from the server instead.

<p>Or, you can Use <a href="ChatRoom.java">The Source</a>, Luke.
See also <a href="ChatServer.java">the server source</a>.
