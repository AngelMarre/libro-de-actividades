JavaCook Source Files

Please note the following changes since the second edition was published:

*)	The files are now maintained in a public CVS repository; see
	http://javacook.darwinsys.com/download.jsp.

*)	All Java files(all but 2) are now in Java packages whose name corresponds
	to the directory they are in (this is of course how most tools including
	Ant and Eclipse expect to find things).
	
*)	The index-bychapter file is substantially out of date since the
	packagification "flag day".

*)	I am using Eclipse for most of my development. This has the unfortunate effect
	that the Ant scripts are now somewhat out of date; if you get them working
	please send me a patch against today's CVS.
	
Sorry for the inconvenience; hopefully these issues will get resolved soon.
