/** Clone of the "link" applet from 
 * http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/popupjava.html
 * It had to be cloned because he doesn't give his Java source code out,
 * and some people need to see that.
 * (His "source code" is really the HTML code needed to make it work,
 * and is no more "source code" than a book about driving is a new car.
 * <P>
 * Even his name is non-standard: Java class names are supposed to begin
 * with a capital letter. Since we're cloning, I've preserved the name.
 * <P>
 * Lowest-common-denominator department: this originally took the
 * Java 1.0 approach, so it can workey in turkey old browsers.
 * It is now at Java 1.1, which means no Netscape 2 or 3-era browsers.
